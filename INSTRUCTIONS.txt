The data I used is available as one of the public Amazon EBS volumes, called ENSEMBL annotated human genome data (FASTA release 68).  Unlike the prototype, the final version does not require the data to be uncompressed first.  

The compare.cpp file should be compiled and run on an Amazon EC2 cc2.8xlarge node.  It takes three parameters:
1. The path to the data folder.
2. A text file containing a list of pairs of species to be compared.  There should be one pair on each line, separated by a comma.  
3. A maximum number of genes from each species to compare.  A good value seems to be around 1000.

To run on multiple machines simultaneously, you must manually start the program on each instance.  However, the utilities.py file contains a function 'generateJobs', which takes as input a list of species, the data folder, a number of machines, and a value for the maximum number of genes, and outputs a folder containing input files for the different machines.  

The utilities.py file also contains a function that will pull the cDNA data out of the dataset and move it into a new folder.  I used this to make my own snapshot so I didn't have to make a 210 GB volume every time I wanted to access the data.  This function just takes the source folder path and destination folder path as arguments.

The analyze.py file contains a function called run.  The input to this function should be the path to the folder you get after compiling and running compare.cpp and consolidating all the output folders.  This function will currently just generate a genetic tree diagram from the data.
